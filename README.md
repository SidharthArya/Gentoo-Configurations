Just some basic personally preferred configurations for gentoo. Maybe useful for beginners. Though i would urge you to user your own. But Gentoo can be tough for beginners. So feel free to use this, or my binary gentoo packages in my other repository.

Note: If you do choose to change the USE flags or something else even a bit from mine. Do not use my binary packages again. It's fine to use initially, But eventually when you start tweaking don't bother with my binary packages, Or atleast take some time to read my configs before using a binary package which may take hours to compile.
